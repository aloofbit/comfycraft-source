// Module-side hook implementations for the vendored playerbots tree.
//
// Everything the host used to reach through a free function or a Player::
// method now arrives here through Penqle module system hooks. The one call the
// core still makes unconditionally is World::InitPlayerbotsAtStartup(), which
// registers the objects below: a bootstrap has to come from somewhere, and a
// file-scope instance would race the ScriptRegistry containers during static
// initialisation.
//
// The hooks carry names that mean something to the core, not to this module -
// IsAIControlled, HasAIFollowers, GetAllowedRoles. A second module answering
// the same questions plugs into the same names.
//
// Bodies below are the former HostHooks.cpp implementations moved verbatim,
// instrumentation and all. Nothing is reworded here; behaviour changes belong
// in their own commit.
