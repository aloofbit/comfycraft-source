// Playerbot_RecruitBotForPlayer -- the module half of SCRIPT_COMMAND_RECRUIT_BOT (93).
//
// The gossip end of companions: click an option on Hall Steward Corwin and a
// companion of the asked-for role joins your party, or every companion you have
// is dismissed.
//
// REWRITTEN 2026-09-06, from FINDING to MAKING.
//
//   The first version searched the live 300-bot random population for somebody
//   free, of the right role, near your level. That is why the old gossip text
//   talks about sending word to whoever is closest and warns that nobody
//   suitable might be free -- at Goldshire levels "nobody is free" was the
//   normal answer, not an edge case, because ~4-5 bots exist per level split
//   across two factions and nine classes, minus everyone already grouped.
//
//   Companions are now CREATED to order at your exact level and dismissed by
//   deleting them, so availability is infinite and the level gap is always
//   zero. The whole search, and IsAvailableForHire with it, is gone.
//
// WHY IT IS SPLIT ACROSS THE MODULE BOUNDARY:
//   No file under src/game includes a playerbot header - the core does not
//   depend on the module. The established seam is a free function declared
//   `extern` at the core call site, implemented here, and stubbed out in
//   src/game/PlayerbotStubs.cpp for BUILD_PLAYERBOTS=OFF builds.
