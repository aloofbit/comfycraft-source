//  Who owns a companion.
//
//  Companions are playerbots created to order on hire and deleted on dismiss,
//  living on a server-owned COMPANION0..N account pool rather than the hiring
//  player's own account (which caps at 9 characters shared with their real
//  ones). That move breaks the module's idea of ownership, which is:
//
//      it is on a random-pool account, OR it is on your account
//
//  A companion is neither, so `.bot delete` would answer "Not your bot". This
//  is the missing third notion: companion guid -> owning character guid.
//
//  EPHEMERAL, WITH A GRACE PERIOD. A companion is not a character anybody
//  keeps; it is an implementation detail with the lifetime of one hire. But
//  since 2026-09-09 the hire survives its owner going away for a while: the
//  owner's logout PARKS it (ParkAll) rather than dismissing it, and the
//  owner's next login brings it back if that was within
//  AiPlayerbot.CompanionParkMinutes, or deletes it if not. A dropped
//  connection and a server restart are the same case (PurgeAtStartup keeps
//  a parked companion whose owner still exists and is inside the window),
//  so relogging for an addon or a rebuild does not cost a dungeon party.
//  Everything the table cannot vouch for is still deleted at startup, which
//  is what keeps a crash from leaking characters into the pool for ever.
//
//  Storage is an in-memory map written through to `tw_char.companion_owner`
//  (sql/custom/066, parked_time from 071). Reads are all in-memory: they
//  happen on the XP path and on every delete, and neither wants a query.
