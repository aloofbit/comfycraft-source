// SOMEBODY STANDING STILL INSIDE A SPAWNED BUILDING IS NOT DRAWN TO SOMEBODY
// WHO HAS JUST WALKED IN, and they arrive hanging two yards over the floor.
// One late packet answers both, because both are the same fault wearing two
// hats: the client has not finished placing anybody when the arrival lands.
//
// Measured 2026-09-03 with LogFilter_VisibilityChanges off -- three controlled
// arrivals whose SERVER logs are line-for-line identical:
//
//   Ragefire Chasm, real dungeon geometry ... 7.73yd ... drawn
//   House, owner INSIDE the Goldshire Inn ... 1.44yd ... NOT drawn
//   House, owner outside the inn ............ 9.13yd ... drawn
//
// So the create block goes out correctly and the client throws one away. A
// spawned building has collision but NOT the client's portal system -- already
// why sky and terrain show through indoors -- and it turns out to cost units
// too, because the client places what it draws by which WMO group it is in and
// cannot resolve one.
//
// THREE THINGS WERE WRONG AT ONCE and each fix alone read as a flat failure,
// which is the part worth keeping: a fix that changes nothing is not proof the
// theory is wrong when the theory has three independent preconditions.
//
//   DELIVERY. SendHeartBeat goes through WorldObject::SendMovementMessageToSet,
//   which for a Player uses the PlayerBroadcaster -- or, with
//   Network.PacketBroadcast.Threads = 0 which is what this server runs, a
//   fallback branch reading `SendObjectMessageToSet(&data, true, except)`. The
//   self argument is HARDCODED true there, so `includingSelf = false` is
//   silently ignored. Nothing is broadcast here: every occupant is described
//   straight to every occupant's session.
//
//   POSITION. A plain heartbeat carries the position the unit is ALREADY at, so
//   the client reads no change and does nothing with it. Real movement, which
//   does fix it, carries a different one. Hence the hop -- and hence a second
//   truthful packet, so nothing is left displaced.
//
//   TIMING. A beat sent from DungeonMap::Add lands in the same instant as the
//   create block and does nothing at all. HOUSE_NUDGE_DELAY is the whole point
//   of this being armed rather than sent.
//
// AND IT FIXED A BUG NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR, found because the ignored self
// flag was curing it by accident: THE ARRIVING PLAYER'S OWN MODEL is invisible
// to them until they move. That half is kept and is now asked for -- it would
// have been deleted silently the moment the self flag was "corrected".
//
// The precedent is three lines from the code this was found in:
// MovementHandler.cpp:278 already beats once after a teleport to un-stick the
// MacOS client's camera, a different client-side rendering fault of the same
// shape.
#define HOUSE_NUDGE_LIFT    0.05f       // the hop: a real delta, invisible
// THE DELAY IS `arrival_ping_ms`, A SERVER-WIDE SETTING, defaulting to 3000.
//
// MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN, because it is pure client behaviour and no amount of
// reading settles it. The sweep that found the fix beat at every tick from 1 to
// 6, then each end was separated by hand: **3000ms works, 2000ms does not,
// 1500ms does not.** So the boundary is between 2 and 3 seconds.
//
// 2500 WAS DELIBERATELY NOT TRIED. It might well work, and it would sit
// directly on a load race -- which does not fail cleanly. It fails SOMETIMES,
// on a busier house or a slower machine, and presents as the whole feature
// never having worked. The asymmetry decides it: too low costs the feature,
// silently and intermittently; too high costs a couple of seconds of an
// empty-looking room. Half a second of margin is not worth that class of bug.
//
// AND IT IS A SETTING RATHER THAN A CONSTANT FOR THAT SAME REASON. A load race
// is a property of the machine and the client, not of this code, so 3000 is the
// right answer HERE and cannot be the right answer everywhere. An operator on
// slower hardware must be able to raise it once and have it stick -- which is
// what separates this from `.house object marker` and `.house entrance model`,
// the other live-tuned knobs, where the answer is found once and then belongs
// in the source.
//
// If it is ever retuned, search DOWNWARD from a value confirmed to work; going
// up from one that fails is a test per guess, which is what the sweep existed
// to avoid.

// ONE PING, LATE -- not a sweep. The sweep was how the delay was FOUND: one
// delay per build is one bit per build, and two builds had already gone on
// single guesses, so beating across the whole plausible range settled it in
// one. Keeping the sweep afterwards would be keeping the scaffolding.

// THE ANIMALS NEED THE SAME NUDGE AS THE PEOPLE, and it took two goes to send

// LogFileLevel 3, a guest walking in logs:
//
//   Creature (Entry: 721 Guid: 8000000) is visible now for Player Awd. Distance = 6.43
//
// So the create block goes out correctly at six yards and the client declines
// to DRAW it -- the same fault as a player standing in a spawned building,
// on a different object type. The client cannot resolve which WMO group the
// thing is in, so it never places it anywhere.
//
// AND IT IS A DRAWING FAULT, NOT A DELIVERY ONE. The owner settled that in one
// move: `.house critter drag` makes the animal appear for everybody, and drag
// only ever MOVES it. A client cannot move something it has thrown away, so
// the object was there on every client the whole time. That also kills the
// obvious "re-send the create block" fix before it costs a build.
//
// SO CALL THE WHOLE OF NearTeleportTo RATHER THAN HAND-ROLLING THE PACKET.
// The first attempt sent MSG_MOVE_TELEPORT to every occupant's session by hand
// -- the shape of the player beat -- and changed nothing. Two things it left
// out, and drag has both:
//
//   DisableSpline(). A wandering critter is mid-spline half the time, and a
//   teleport aimed at a unit the client is already interpolating is one the
//   client can carry straight on over.
//
//   A REAL DISTANCE. The player beat's 0.05yd lift is enough for somebody
//   standing still. There is no reason to assume it is enough for something
//   already moving.
//
// So this is drag, minus the part that changes where the animal lives: lift it
// a hair, put it back, both through the function that provably works. It
// interrupts and resets the movement generator on the way, which is what stops
// the spline fighting it, and ending on the truthful call leaves the animal
// exactly where it was standing.

// WHY THIS IS A STORED POINT AND NOT A ONE-STEP GESTURE. Ground targeting is
// raised entirely client-side. Every spell-related SMSG in this build reports a
// cast that is already under way -- SPELL_START, SPELL_GO, CAST_RESULT and the
// rest -- and there is no opcode that induces the client to begin one. So no
// dot command and no gossip option can ever put the cursor into targeting mode;
// using an item can, and an item that places nothing itself has nowhere to put
// the point except here. The two-step is forced by the protocol.
//
// IT IS VISIBLE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT IS ACCEPTABLE. A remembered
// point that silently changes where the next thing lands is exactly the kind of
// invisible state housing keeps arriving at and rejecting. The glow is what
// makes it ordinary instead: the mark is a thing you can see standing on the
// floor, and it goes out when it is spent.
