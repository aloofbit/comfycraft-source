/*
 * Edit mode -- click-to-decorate.
 *
 * `.house move 0 0 1` works, but typing offsets at a chair is not how anybody
 * wants to arrange a room. In edit mode the furniture itself highlights under
 * the cursor and right-clicking it opens a menu that nudges, spins, resizes and
 * picks up exactly that object.
 *
 * THE FURNITURE IS THE HANDLE, and it is one field swapped per viewer. While an
 * object is in your edit session Object::BuildValuesUpdate tells YOUR client --
 * and nobody else's -- that GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_ID is GOOBER, which is a type
 * GameObject::Use raises gossip for. The server still reads CHAIR everywhere,
 * so Update(), Use()'s switch and every GetGOInfo() union read stay correct, a
 * guest sees ordinary furniture, and nothing has to be put back on the way out.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-03 this summoned a small hovering gear beside every object and
 * you clicked that instead, because a chair could not be clicked at all. Three
 * findings from that design are worth keeping, since they still bound what is
 * possible here:
 *
 *  - FURNITURE CAN NEVER BE THE NPC ITSELF. CreatureModelData.dbc is 788
 *    models and every one is a .mdx; there is not a single .wmo. A chair can
 *    never wear its own model as a creature without a client patch -- which is
 *    why the marker was a separate object rather than the furniture wearing a
 *    creature's clothes.
 *
 *  - A HANDLE CANNOT BE INVISIBLE. The invisible stalker model is the reflex
 *    choice for a marker everywhere else in this DB and was exactly wrong here:
 *    the entire mechanism was clicking it. The same rule survives in the
 *    selection glow, which is a visible summon for a visible reason.
 *
 *  - THE MENU NEEDS NO DATABASE ROWS. GossipMenu::AddMenuItem and
 *    PlayerMenu::SendGossipMenu build a menu in code, so none of the gossip
 *    limits that shape sql/custom/003 and 004 apply here: no gossip_menu entry
 *    out of the nearly-full smallint space, no gossip_menu_option rows, no
 *    npc_option_npcflag trap. The one unavoidable row is the greeting, because
 *    SendGossipMenu takes an npc_text id rather than a string -- which is why
 *    each PAGE having its own title costs three rows (sql/custom/049).
 *
 * THE SESSION IS THE STATE AND IT IS MEMORY-ONLY. `wanted` is what you may
 * click; `marked` is what the client has actually been told, which lags by one
 * Reconcile pass because telling it costs a despawn and a respawn of the
 * object. Nothing is persisted, so a crash or a restart mid-edit leaves nothing
 * behind.
 *
 * Ownership is not checked separately in the menu below. The session is keyed
 * by the editing player, so a click can only ever reach a menu on an object
 * that player was already being shown as clickable -- and HouseMgr's own
 * CheckOwner still guards every mutation underneath.

// session the client is told it is a GOOBER -- per viewer, in
// Object::BuildValuesUpdate -- so it highlights under the cursor and can be
// clicked. What it cannot do is find a script: housing furniture uses 15,550
// stock gameobject_template rows we do not own, so `script_name` is not
// available and pGOHello / pGOGossipSelect will never fire for one.
//
// So the core calls these two directly instead, from the two places a
// gameobject click can arrive: GameObject::Use, and the IsGameObject() branch
// of HandleGossipSelectOptionOpcode. Both are guarded by the housing guid
// range before they get here, and both are `extern` free functions because
// that is the seam this repo already uses to reach a module from the core.
//
// GUARDED BY THE EDIT SESSION, NOT BY OWNERSHIP. InEditSession is the same
// question the type override asks, so a click can only ever reach a menu on an
// object the player was already being shown as clickable. Everything the menu
// then does still goes through the mutators, which check ownership themselves.
// A gameobject guid carries its ENTRY as well as its low guid, and the client
// checks both -- send a mismatched entry and the select comes back for an
// object the client has never heard of. house_object.go_entry is where it
