/*
 * Player housing.
 *
 * A house is one instance of the house map, owned by an account, with the
 * objects the owner has placed in it stored in `tw_char.house_object`.
 *
 * The core already has every mechanism this needs; the manager mostly wires
 * them together. Three of them are worth knowing before reading the .cpp:
 *
 *  - Which instance a player enters is decided in exactly one place,
 *    Player::GetBoundInstanceSaveForSelfOrGroup(), and a PERMANENT bind wins
 *    over a group bind. So "go to my house" is just a permanent bind plus an
 *    ordinary teleport.
 *  - A grid loads its objects from two sets: the global spawns keyed by map,
 *    and MapPersistentState's own per-instance set (ObjectGridLoader.cpp:207).
 *    Furniture goes in the second, which is why one player's chair is not in
 *    everybody else's house.
 *  - An instance with a far-future reset time is never collected:
 *    ScheduleAllDungeonResets queues it beyond any horizon,
 *    _CleanupExpiredInstancesAtTime only deletes rows whose resettime is in
 *    the past, and CleanupInstances only deletes rows nothing is bound to.
 *    That is why houses need no change to the reset machinery.

// GOOBER), so nothing summons one and the constants that shaped it are gone.
//
// The row survives in sql/custom/022-025, unreferenced and harmless. Two of
// its findings are worth keeping even though the object is not: a handle could
// never be the usual invisible stalker, because the whole point was clicking
// it; and it had to be a GAMEOBJECT rather than a creature, because a creature
// model carries an ambient loop through CreatureModelData -> CreatureSoundData
// that cannot be silenced from this side -- the client reads its own copy out
// of the MPQ. That is why the selection glow below is an ENCHANTMENT effect
// and not a fire or a portal, which would hum at the owner forever.

// The glow that marks the selected object. `SPELLS ENCHANTMENTS
// WhiteGlow_High.mdx` -- a STOCK Turtle template, so this needs no SQL of its
// own; it is only ever summoned, never edited, so a world update cannot take it
// away the way it would revert an edited row.
//
// An ENCHANTMENT glow specifically, and that is the reason it can be used at
// all. SummonHandle's comment records why the gear had to be solid geometry:
// effect models animate and carry their own sound emitters inside the .mdx,
// which no DBC edit can reach, so a fire or a portal effect would hum at the
// owner forever. The enchant shimmer is the quiet corner of that shelf.
// The two spells a furniture crate can carry, and the only difference that
// matters is Targets: 0x40 (TARGET_FLAG_DEST_LOCATION) makes the client raise
// its ground reticle and send back the point, 0x0 makes it a plain use.
// Measured against server/dbc/Spell.dbc 2026-09-03; both read Stances 0,
// powerType 0, SpellFamilyName 0, so neither is gated by class or form.
//
// 261 is the one sql/custom/042 settled on after three attempts -- see 046 for
// the two that failed and why reading the DBC harder was not the way to pick
// one. 482 is what the crates carried before that work, so it is proven rather
// than guessed: it shipped, and placement simply went ahead of the player.
// AND THE AHEAD ONE ALSO HAS TO CAST. With nothing to aim at, the moment
// between deciding and getting is empty, so 33453 "Over-Tinkered Lens" is
// there for its one-second bar and its crafting animation -- SpellVisual 215,
// which 24 real recipes use, so it is an animation the client already draws
// for making something rather than a guess at one.
//
// Chosen off the profile that settled 261, not off its description: Targets 0,
// Stances 0, StancesNot 0, powerType 0, manaCost 0, SpellFamilyName 0,
// Attributes 0x0, no reagent, no totem, no cooldown, effect DUMMY only, and a
// blank tooltip so the item's green Use line stays empty. That is Rough
// Dynamite's profile exactly, which is the bar sql/custom/046 sets.
//
// WHICH ANIMATION IT ACTUALLY DRAWS IS A QUESTION FOR THE CLIENT, and
// sql/custom/053 is the probe for it -- throwaway item entries, one per
// candidate, because a NEW entry is not in the client's WDB cache and can be
// compared with .additem in one sitting. Swapping this constant is the whole
// change once one wins.
// The spells the crates and the chalk carry live in sql/custom/042+055 and 054
// and are not named here any more. There were two constants for them while the
// server chose between them at runtime; nothing chooses now -- both are written
// once by SQL. A constant no code reads is a comment that can go stale without

//    takes that one object back out.

// closes the window and that is all -- the room-wide exit is its own row.
