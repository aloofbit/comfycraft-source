/*
 * The way in.
 *
 * `.house go` works, but typing a command is not an entrance. This puts a
 * portal in the world -- in the doorway of a real house, wherever you choose --
 * and walking into it takes you to your own instance. A second portal inside
 * the house walks you back out to the same doorway.
 *
 * Three things decided the shape of this, all of them found by reading:
 *
 *  - AN AREATRIGGER CANNOT BE USED, even though that is exactly what a real
 *    dungeon entrance is. CMSG_AREATRIGGER is sent by the CLIENT when it walks
 *    into a trigger box listed in its own AreaTrigger.dbc, and the server only
 *    ever reacts to it (MiscHandler.cpp:770). There is no way to add one, so
 *    trigger locations are stuck wherever Blizzard put them. ScriptMgr's
 *    OnAreaTrigger hook and the `scripted_areatrigger` table are real and
 *    usable -- they are just useless for a portal that has to go somewhere new.
 *
 *  - GAMEOBJECTS TICK, which is what makes walk-through possible anyway.
 *    GameObject::Update calls AI()->UpdateAI(diff) for every gameobject in a
 *    loaded grid (GameObject.cpp:338), and GameObjectAI is bound by
 *    gameobject_template.script_name through ScriptMgr::GetGameObjectAI. So the
 *    portal watches for somebody standing in it. Polling rather than a callback,
 *    because no "a player entered my radius" event exists for a gameobject.
 *
 *  - THE SEARCH MUST BE GRID-LIMITED. The obvious loop over map->GetPlayers()
 *    is what the edit handles do, and it is right there because a house holds
 *    one player. The world portal sits on a continent carrying 300 random bots,
 *    where a full scan four times a second would be a real cost for nothing.
 *    Cell::VisitWorldObjects only ever looks at the cells within range.
 *
 * The entrance is a persistent spawn registered with sObjectMgr's GLOBAL grid
 * set, not a house instance's -- it belongs to the world, so it loads with the
 * world's grids exactly like any tw_world.gameobject row. The exit portal inside
 * each house is the opposite: a temporary summon, re-made whenever the instance
 * loads, so it needs no carved-out guid block. Same reasoning as the handles.

// side was never the problem; the art is.
//
// THE OBSERVATION STANDS AND THE OLD EXPLANATION DOES NOT. This said
// Creature_Spellportal_Purple.m2 "carries no hit volume", which was reasoning
// rather than measurement, and it is contradicted by the server's own
// extractor: display 21585 IS one of the 6,604 ids in
// vmaps/temp_gameobject_models, with a healthy 0.42 x 1.81 x 2.36 yard box --
// BIGGER than the gear that works, which is a 3.78 model at 0.15 scale.
// Checked 2026-09-03, along with the two other differences that could have
// explained it and do not: both templates are type 10 GOOBER with flags 0 and
// faction 0, both are born GO_STATE_READY, and both are set GO_STATE_ACTIVE
// afterwards (which only disables the SERVER's vmap model anyway). The only
// field left that differs is displayId.
//
// So what is untrue is "this model has nothing to hit", and what is true is
// "this model is not pickable by the client", which is a different claim and
// one no file on disk answers -- effect models generally are not. THE LEVER IS
// THE DISPLAY ID, and `.house entrance model <id> [scale]` tries one live
// without saving it. If a portal-ish model with real geometry rather than
// particles takes a click, this gear can go.
//
// So the menu hangs on a small gear standing in the portal, which is the same
// answer the edit handles already are. It is a TEMPORARY summon for the same
// reason they are: Map::SummonGameObject hardcodes Create(..., GO_STATE_READY),
// which is the state a clickable goober has to be born in, and it costs no guid
// block. The portal AI keeps it standing, so a grid unload and reload simply
// grows a new one.
// IS ANYBODY CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE OFFERED THE GEAR?
//
// BOTS DO NOT COUNT, and out in the world that is not a nicety. The entrances
// stand in Ironforge and 300 random bots roam the continent around them, so a
