// THE ADDON'S COPY OF THE LIST, over the channel Turtle's own threat meter

// LANG_ADDON with "prefix\tbody", which the client demultiplexes into a
// CHAT_MSG_ADDON event -- so this reaches the addon and never touches the chat
// frame.
//
// THAT IS WHY THIS IS NOT SCREEN-SCRAPING. The obvious way to give the addon a
// list was to have it read the lines the command already prints, and it would
// have worked -- at the price of suppressing them again, which in 1.12 means
// hooking ChatFrame_OnEvent globally, because ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter
// is 2.x and is not in this client (0 hits in WoW.exe). A real channel that was
// already proven in this build beat a hook that breaks other addons.
//
// Three message kinds, so the addon can rebuild atomically rather than patching:
//
//   H <selectedSlot> <editMode> <placed> <cap>       begin -- clears its buffer
//   O <slot>:<yards>:<flags>:<entry>:<name>;...      rows, chunked
//   E <count>                                        commit
//
// The ENTRY rides along so the panel can put the object's picture beside its
// name: the addon ships a thumbnail per display id and a gameobject entry is
// what indexes them. The server never needs it -- it is carried purely because
// the addon cannot derive it from anything else it is given.
//
// Chunked because a chat packet is not the place to discover a length limit,
// and a house may hold 100 player objects on top of its fabric.
