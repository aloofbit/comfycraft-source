/*
 * House critters -- rabbits, cats, turtles, anything that potters about.
 *
 * THE WHOLE FEATURE IS ONE LINE DIFFERENT FROM FURNITURE, and that is not a
 * figure of speech. ObjectGridLoader::Visit loads a grid from two sets, the
 * global one and the instance's own:
 *
 *     LoadHelper(cell_guids.gameobjects, ...);
 *     LoadHelper(map->GetPersistentState()->GetCellObjectGuids(id).gameobjects, ...);
 *
 * and the creature overload three lines below it does exactly the same thing
 * to `.creatures`. So `AddCreatureToGrid` where `AddGameobjectToGrid` stood is
 * the entire trick that makes a rabbit belong to one house rather than to
 * every house on map 28.
 *
 * Map 28 was chosen partly for carrying no creature spawns of its own -- still
 * true, checked 2026-09-04, zero rows -- so nothing of the world's leaks in
 * beside them. It also has mmaps, which map 169 never did, so they can
 * actually walk.
 *
 * CRATES ARRIVED 2026-09-04 (sql/custom/058 + 059). An animal is bought as an
 * item, released by right-clicking it in your own house, and boxed back up by
 * picking it up -- exactly the furniture loop, sharing furniture's item script
 * and its on-use spell so that no new spell script name had to be bound. See
 * the ---- crates ---- block below and HouseMgr::UseCritterItem.
 *
 * CLICKING AND NAMING ARRIVED THE SAME DAY. Right-click one you own for a menu
 * (per-viewer UNIT_NPC_FLAGS, see the note above SendCritterMenu) and name it
 * (the pet name query, the only per-instance naming this client has -- see
 * DressCritter). docs/critters.md is the whole story.
 *
 * STILL NOT DONE: thumbnails for pets, and anything resembling feeding,
 * breeding or following.

    // so a renamed hunter pet invalidates that cache.
    //
    // IT ASKS FOR AN OWNERLESS UNIT, which is the fact that could not be read
    // out of the core and had to be measured:
    //
    //   [critter-probe] CMSG_PET_NAME_QUERY petnumber=8000000
    //                   guid=Creature (Entry: 1933 Guid: 8000000)
    //
    // No CREATEDBY, no SUMMONEDBY, no charmer, no pet frame -- just a non-zero
    // UNIT_FIELD_PETNUMBER. Do not "tidy" the three writes below into a
    // condition about ownership; ownerless is the tested case.
    //
    // InitCharmInfo is inert -- a passive holder, no owner, no CHARMEDBY, no
    // faction change, no following -- and the only general-purpose branch that
    // keys off it (MotionMaster::Initialize) just clears three booleans that
    // were already false. Checked before writing this.
    //
    // THE PET NUMBER IS THE CRITTER GUID, which is unique, stable across a
    // relog, and starts at 8,000,000 -- far above anything GeneratePetNumber
    // will reach, so a real hunter pet can never collide and inherit a rabbit's
    // name out of the client's cache.

// GIVING AN ANIMAL A NAME.
//
// The name reaches the client through the PET NAME query, which is the only
// per-instance naming this client has: creature names come from
// creature_template and are cached BY ENTRY, so naming one rabbit would name
// every rabbit in the world. Pet names are cached by PET NUMBER instead, and
// UNIT_FIELD_PET_NAME_TIMESTAMP is the field that invalidates that cache --
// which is exactly what renaming needs, and is a strong hint this is the
// intended road.
//
// Sanitised rather than refused. Somebody typing an apostrophe at a rabbit
// should get a named rabbit, not a lecture -- so the awkward characters are
// removed and whatever is left is the name. Only an empty result is an error.
//
// WHAT IS STRIPPED AND WHY:
//   '|'  starts a chat escape (|c colour, |H hyperlink). An unbalanced one
//        can eat the rest of a chat line.
//   ':'  is the addon sync's field separator -- ComfyHousing parses
//        slot:entry:count:name with one string.find, and CLAUDE.md's rule for
//        that channel is to SANITISE names rather than escape them.

/*
 * RIGHT-CLICK AN ANIMAL IN YOUR OWN HOUSE AND IT OPENS A MENU.
 *
 * THE WHOLE TRICK IS ONE FLAG, SWAPPED PER VIEWER -- the same shape as edit
 * mode's GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_ID swap next door. Object::BuildValuesUpdate already
 * rewrites UNIT_NPC_FLAGS per target (that is how a trainer stops looking like
 * one to the wrong class), so a house critter is told to its OWNER that it
 * carries UNIT_NPC_FLAG_GOSSIP, and to nobody else. The client then draws the
 * talk cursor and sends CMSG_GOSSIP_HELLO.
 *
 * AND THE SERVER SIDE NEEDED NO PERSUADING AT ALL, which is the happy accident
 * that made this small. HandleGossipHelloOpcode asks
 * GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(guid, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_NONE), and CanInteractWithNPC
 * SKIPS the flag test when the mask is 0:
 *
 *     if (npcflagmask && !pCreature->HasFlag(UNIT_NPC_FLAGS, npcflagmask))
 *
 * So the server was always willing to open a gossip session with a rabbit --
 * alive, friendly, selectable, not in combat, within INTERACTION_DISTANCE, all
 * of which a house critter is. Only the client had to be convinced. Nothing
 * here fights a permission check, and the server's own copy of the flag is
 * never touched, so a guest sees an ordinary animal and every other read of
 * UNIT_NPC_FLAGS stays true.
 *
 * NO MODE, AND THEREFORE NO BLINK. Edit mode has to flash its furniture
 * because the client caches a gameobject's type from its creation block and
 * will not re-read it -- so turning the mode on has to re-send every object.
 * A critter's owner never changes while they are standing there, so the flag
 * is simply correct from the moment the creature is created for them. The
 * question "does the client re-read UNIT_NPC_FLAGS" never has to be answered.
 *
 * TWO CORE HOOKS, because a house critter can never have a script: it uses
 * stock creature_template rows we do not own, so script_name is not ours to
 * set and pGossipHello / pGossipSelect can never fire for one. The core calls
 * housing directly from the two places a creature gossip click arrives, both
 * declared in HouseMgr.h -- exactly the seam the gameobject click already uses.
