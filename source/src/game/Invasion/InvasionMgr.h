/*
 * InvasionMgr -- world PvP where only one side signs up.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF IT. You right-click the Invader's Sigil. The server sweeps
 * everyone online for someone flagged for PvP within a few levels of you,
 * tells THEM they are being hunted, and a few seconds later teleports YOU in
 * behind them. When one of you falls the hunt is over, and the invader is sent
 * home to the spot the sigil was used from.
 *
 * A DEFENDER WHO LOSES DIES NORMALLY -- corpse, graveyard, run back. Only the
 * invader is resurrected, and only because they are the one standing a
 * continent from home; see OnPlayerDeath for why the asymmetry is deliberate
 * rather than an oversight.
 *
 * A FALLEN INVADER IS NOT SNATCHED BACK TO LIFE. They lie dead where they fell
 * for Invasion.DeathLingerSeconds, are carried home STILL DEAD, and wake a
 * moment later at the spot they set out from. Standing up instantly on the
 * winner's doorstep and then loitering there until the return timer fired read
 * as a bug in game even though it was doing exactly what it was told.
 *
 * ONLY THE INVADER IS EVER TELEPORTED, and that is the whole consent story.
 * The defender keeps their ground, their friends and their guards; they are
 * never moved, never asked, and lose nothing but the fight. So there is no
 * SMSG_SUMMON_REQUEST here and no accept/decline dialog: the one person who
 * gets moved is the one who pressed the button. The defender's PvP flag is
 * what makes them findable, and the warning is what makes it fair.
 *
 * THE ONLY LIMIT IS ON BEING INVADED. There is no cooldown on the sigil and no
 * cooldown on the person holding it -- hunt again the moment you are home if you
 * want to. What is rationed is how often the same player can be hunted, because
 * that is the half nobody consented to; see m_respite.
 *
 * NOTHING IS PERSISTED, ON PURPOSE. An invasion lives in this vector and
 * nowhere else, so a logout or a restart ends it -- and ending it always means
 * putting the invader back where they started. That is why OnPlayerLogout
 * teleports before the character is saved rather than after: the alternative is
 * a `characters` column, a migration, and a way to strand somebody in the
 * Barrens if the server dies at the wrong moment.
 *
 * IT LEANS ON FACTIONLESS FOR ONE THING. Two players of the same faction can
 * only fight each other because Factionless.Enable makes the PvP flag, rather
 * than the race, decide hostility (docs/features/factionless.md, piece 1).
 * Without that this would be Alliance-versus-Horde only, which halves the pool.
 * Sanctuary is the other half of that feature and it is a hard blocker rather
 * than a nuisance: two players in a sanctuary resolve FRIENDLY, so an invasion
 * that lands in one cannot be fought at all. Both ends are checked, twice --
 * at search time and again on arrival, because people walk.
