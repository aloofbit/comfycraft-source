/*
 * BotNpcIdle -- what a bot NPC does when nobody has told it to do anything.
 *
 * A bot NPC stands there, deliberately. PlayerbotAI's update returns before
 * DoNextAction for anything IsBotNpc(), because the first one placed in the
 * world re-rolled its gear on a loop and then wandered off to attack something,
 * and a character conscripted as scenery needs the AI switched OFF rather than
 * tuned down. This is the other half: what it should do INSTEAD, written down
 * by a person on `/admin/npcbots` rather than decided by an engine.
 *
 * Four rules, one per trigger (BotNpc.h):
 *
 *      loop         every `period` seconds, while nobody is talking to it
 *      near         a real player crosses into `radius` yards, once per visit
 *      after_talk   a conversation with it ends
 *      custom       a Lua scene holding its own loop, started once
 *
 * The first three run an ordinary `generic_scripts` timeline with the NPC as
 * source and whoever set it off as target, so there is no second executor and
 * no new script command: say, emote, walk, cast, play an effect, run a Lua
 * scene.
 *
 * `custom` is the one that is not on a clock at all. It is a scene, started the
 * first time the NPC is seen standing in the world and never put on a timer --
 * every wait in it is one the author wrote. What starts it again is a bump of
 * BotNpcMgr::Generation(), which every `reload bot_npc` does, so saving on the
 * website lands the way it does for a timeline.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ THREADING
 *
 * ONE DRIVER PER MAP, HELD BY VALUE, TICKED FROM Map::Update. That is the same
 * thread the scripts execute on, the same thread LuaScene resumes on, and the
 * only thread on which a grid search is safe while maps update in parallel.
 *
 * It is also the thread CMSG_GOSSIP_HELLO is handled on -- that opcode is
 * PACKET_PROCESS_MAP, drained by Map::Update itself -- which is why NoteTalk
 * needs no lock.
 *
 * Player::Update would have been the obvious alternative and is wrong:
 * Map::UpdatePlayers skips inactive players on continents, and a bot NPC
 * standing alone in a field is the definition of one.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------ WHAT IT COSTS
 *
 * One pass over the map's player list per second, and only when at least one
 * design anywhere has a rule (sBotNpcMgr.AnyIdleRules()). On a server that has
 * never written one, that is a bool.
