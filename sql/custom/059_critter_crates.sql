-- ============================================================================
--  Critter crates: animals you can buy, place and pick up          (tw_world)
-- ============================================================================
--  The critter half of sql/custom/042. Until now the only way to put a rabbit
--  in a house was `.house critter add 721`, a raw creature entry out of 129.
--  This makes an animal something a player can hold: an ordinary inventory
--  item that releases its critter when you right-click it inside your own
--  house, and comes back to your bags when you pick it up.
--
--  IT REUSES THE FURNITURE SCRIPT AND THE FURNITURE SPELL ON PURPOSE, and that
--  is the single most important line in this file. script_name is
--  'item_house_furniture' and the on-use spell is 33453, exactly as a chair
--  carries -- so:
--
--    * no new item script, and therefore no new AddSC line, no new file in
--      src/scripts/CMakeLists.txt, no configure re-run;
--    * NO NEW spell_template.script_name ROW, which is the one that bites:
--      spell script names are read ONCE AT STARTUP, so a new binding needs the
--      SQL in place BEFORE the restart meant to pick it up. Reusing 33453
--      means sql/custom/052 and 055 already did that, years of debugging ago.
--
--  The housing side tells the two apart by ITEM ENTRY: HouseFurnitureShouldCast
--  and HouseUseFurnitureItem look in house_furniture_item first and
--  house_critter_item second. One script, two catalogues.
--
--  SO THE ORDERING TRAP DOES NOT APPLY HERE. Housing's usual rule for an item
--  script is "binary leads the SQL", because SQL naming a script the running
--  binary lacks leaves pItemUse absent and the spell casts for real. Nothing
--  new is named here, so this file can be applied in either order -- though
--  058 must still come before the binary.
--
--    Get-Content sql\custom\059_critter_crates.sql | DB\bin\mariadb.exe -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u root tw_world
--
--  Then, with no restart:
--    .\Reload-Server.ps1 item_template, creature_template, npc_vendor
--    .\Reload-Server.ps1 -Command 'house critter reload'
--
--  Spawn the vendor in-game as GM, standing where you want her:
--    .npc add 100027
--
--  RE-RUNNABLE, AND IT DELETES ITS OWN BLOCK FIRST. New critters go into THIS
--  FILE, not a new numbered one -- the DELETE below would silently wipe a
--  later file's rows the next time anybody re-ran this.

SET @VENDOR := 100027;   -- 100000-100026 are taken; see CLAUDE.md

--  THE ICON IS INV_Box_PetCarrier_01, an actual pet carrier -- ItemDisplayInfo
--  20629, which 17 shipped items use (Black Tabby among them). 22271 and three
--  others carry the same picture; 20629 is simply the commonest.
--
--  This was 7913 (INV_Crate_01's neighbour) for one afternoon, picked by asking
--  which display ids Turtle's own companion pets use most and taking the top
--  answer. That method was sound and the answer was incomplete: 20629 was
--  SECOND on the same list and is the icon literally named for the job, which a
--  frequency count could not tell me. Searching ItemDisplayInfo.dbc field 5 for
--  the icon NAME is the check that was missing -- 4,448 distinct names are in
--  there, and it is the only place the artists' intent is written down.
--
--  Confirmed present in the client's archives before being used here; an icon
--  the client cannot resolve draws as a green square with no error.

--  33453 "Over-Tinkered Lens": Targets 0x0 (no reticle -- the Decorator's
--  Chalk aims every route into housing), CastingTimeIndex 4 = 1000ms, and
--  SpellVisual 215, the crafting animation. sql/custom/052 binds
--  spell_house_furniture_place to THIS entry, which is what makes the number
--  load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Changing it here without changing 052
--  gives a crate that casts and places nothing, with nothing in the log.
--
--  A CRAFTING ANIMATION FOR LETTING A RABBIT OUT is a slight stretch and it is
--  kept deliberately: it is one second of "something is happening" that the
--  player already recognises from furniture, and inventing a second gesture
--  for the same act of putting something down would be two vocabularies for
--  one idea. If it ever grates, the fix is one @USE and one row in 052.

--  The mapping table
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  wander is the roaming radius in yards the animal is released with, the same
--  units `.house critter wander` takes. 0 means it stays where you put it.
--  Kept small on every row: map 28's navmesh describes the flat plain and
--  knows nothing about a spawned building, so a generous radius is how an
--  animal ends up somewhere surprising.

--
--  bonding = 0, tradeable. stackable = 1, deliberately: a stack would release
--  one and leave the rest, and the pick-up path would have to decide whether
--  to merge.
