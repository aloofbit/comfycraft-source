-- ============================================================================
--  Furniture items, and the two people who sell them  (tw_world)
-- ============================================================================
--  Housing milestone M5. Until now the only way to put a chair in a house was
--  .house object add 2413 - a developer command taking a raw gameobject entry
--  out of 15,550. This turns furniture into something a player can hold: an
--  ordinary inventory item that places its model when you right-click it
--  inside your own house, and comes back to your bags when you pick it up.
--
--  THREE PIECES, and they are separate on purpose:
--
--    house_furniture_item   item entry -> gameobject entry. The whole mapping.
--                           Adding furniture later is rows here plus rows in
--                           item_template; no code changes, and
--                           `.house furniture reload` picks it up live.
--    item_template          the items themselves, in 100100-100199 and then
--                           100400-100999. See the DELETEs for why it is two
--                           ranges and not one.
--    creature 100026        Carpenter Bram, a plain vendor window with the
--                           original fifteen in it.
--    creature 100028        Furnisher Adela, the same crates plus everything
--                           since, behind a menu with one page per category.
--                           She supersedes Bram; he is kept because deleting
--                           a spawned NPC is the owner's call, not this file's.
--
--  THE ITEMS ARE ALL ONE ICON - INV_Crate_01, a plain wooden crate (display
--  7914). Vanilla has no chair or table icon, so per-item icons would be a
--  column of near-misses; a flat-pack crate reads as furniture and is honest
--  about it. The ComfyHousing addon shows the actual model on hover, which is
--  what the picture is FOR.
--
--  bonding = 0 - tradeable. Some furniture is meant to be soulbound later;
--  that is bonding = 1 on those rows and nothing else.
--
--  stackable = 1 - deliberately not stackable. A stack of chairs would place
--  one and leave the rest, and the pick-up path would have to decide whether
--  to merge.
--
--  THE STOCK LIST IS NOT EDITED HERE ANY MORE. tools/furniture-list.js is the
--  source; the three blocks between `-- >>> generated:` and `-- <<< generated`
--  markers below are written from it, and everything else in this file -- this
--  header, the research trail on the crates' on-use spell, the vendor
--  rationale, and Carpenter Bram's frozen fifteen -- is hand-written and stays
--  that way.
--
--    node tools/gen-furniture-sql.js add <goEntry...>   propose new rows
--    node tools/gen-furniture-sql.js check              validate, write nothing
--    node tools/gen-furniture-sql.js build              rewrite the blocks here
--
--  Editing a generated block by hand is not wrong, it is just temporary -- the
--  next build overwrites it. Change the list instead.
--
--  Re-runnable. Apply with:
--    Get-Content sql\custom\042_furniture_items.sql | DB\bin\mariadb.exe -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u root tw_world
--
--  APPLY 041 (tw_char) FIRST, and before the new binary - it adds the column
--  the loader now selects, and a missing column is a hard crash. SAME FOR 062,
--  which adds house_furniture_item.category to an install that already has the
--  table; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS below will not add a column to one.
--
--  Spawn a vendor in-game as GM, standing where you want them:
--    .npc add 100026        Carpenter Bram, flat window, the original fifteen
--    .npc add 100028        Furnisher Adela, tabbed, all sixty-four

SET @VENDOR := 100026;   -- 100000-100025 are taken; see CLAUDE.md
SET @SHOP   := 100028;   -- Furnisher Adela, the tabbed shop
SET @ICON   := 7914;     -- ItemDisplayInfo 7914 -> INV_Crate_01, a wooden crate

-- The item's on-use spell exists ONLY so the client offers "Use" and sends
-- CMSG_USE_ITEM. It is never cast: the pItemUse hook returns true, which makes
-- WorldSession::HandleUseItemOpcode skip CastItemUseSpell entirely - so a
-- refusal outside your own house costs the player nothing.
--
-- IT ALSO DECIDES HOW YOU AIM. The client raises the ground reticle - the one
-- dynamite uses - when and only when the spell's Targets mask carries
-- TARGET_FLAG_DEST_LOCATION (0x40), and then puts the clicked point in the
-- packet for SpellCastTargets::read to pick up. Nothing else is consulted:
-- Target Dummy (4071) and the Field Repair Bot (22700) carry implicit target 0
-- and still reticle, while dynamite carries 16.
--
-- PROFILE THE CANDIDATE AGAINST A SPELL THAT PROVABLY WORKS, do not reason
-- about which fields the client checks. Rough Dynamite (4054) works from a bag
-- for any class in any stance, and reads:
--
--   Stances 0, StancesNot 0, powerType 0, manaCost 0, SpellFamilyName 0
--
-- Anything not matching that is a guess. 30012 "Chess Move (DND)" was tried
-- here for one afternoon and is the cautionary tale: right mask, right range,
-- a 5-yard circle identical to dynamite's - and Stances 65536 (Battle Stance),
-- powerType 1 (rage), SpellFamilyName 4 (warrior). Using a crate switched a
-- warrior's stance and drew the red refusal cursor. See sql/custom/046.
--
-- AND ONE MORE FIELD DECIDES WHETHER A GIVEN POINT IS VALID, separately from
-- whether the reticle appears at all: EffectImplicitTargetA. 27651 was tried
-- here after 30012 - it passes the whole profile above - and drew the red
-- refusal cursor for points NEAR the player, green further out, because it
-- carries tgtA 52 (an enumeration target). 0 and 16 are the values that work,
-- and both proven item spells use one of them.
--
-- A CRATE NO LONGER CARRIES A RETICLE SPELL AT ALL. Everything from here to
-- @USE is the research that settled the AIMING spell, and aiming moved to the
-- Decorator's Chalk on 2026-09-03: one item aims every route into housing,
-- where a per-item spell could only ever aim these twelve. See sql/custom/054
-- for the chalk, 055 for what a crate carries now and why its CAST stayed when
-- its reticle went, and docs/notes/point-and-click-placing.md for the retired
-- design. The profiling METHOD below is the part still worth reading -- it is
-- what stopped a third wrong pick.
--
-- 261 "Summon Skeleton" was the settled answer for that job:
--
--   Targets   0x40    the reticle
--   tgtA      0       same as Target Dummy (4071), which works point-blank
--   Stances   0       any class, any form, no stance dance
--   powerType 0       no rage, no mana, no cost of any kind
--   family    0       generic, not somebody's class ability
--   range     0-20    minimum 0, so it is green at your feet; and 20 is under
--                     the server's own 40-yard clamp, so the client's range
--                     check does all the bounding and it can never aim
--                     somewhere the server would then refuse
--   radius    none    NO CIRCLE, just the placement cursor - what Target Dummy
--                     and Field Repair Bot (22700) draw, both shipped items
--                     that work. It is also the SMALLEST indicator available:
--                     no fully-gated spell draws a circle under 10 yards,
--                     which is twice dynamite's.
--   effect    42      never ran; back then pItemUse returned true before the
--                     cast, which is no longer how a crate works -- see 055
--   text      empty description AND tooltip, so the green Use line stays blank
--   attrs     0x0     nothing conditional at all
--   visual    3       confirmed in play to trigger no animation
--   cost      no reagent, no totem, no cooldown, instant
--
-- and it is present in server/dbc/Spell.dbc as well as the client's.
--
-- This was 482 "Reset" until 2026-09-02 - also blank, but Targets 0x0, so
-- placement went three yards ahead of the player and had to be nudged from
-- there. A client that has not re-queried the item still behaves that way; the
-- core falls back to it whenever the flag is absent.
--
-- If a client ever refuses Use on a reticle spell, 46096 - Turtle's own toy
-- dummy, which 75 shipped items prove passes the item cast check from a bag -
-- is the fallback, at the cost of the reticle AND an "Adds a toy to the
-- player's toy collection." line.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  WHAT A CRATE ACTUALLY CARRIES: 33453 "Over-Tinkered Lens"
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  Targets 0x0 (no reticle -- the chalk aims), a 1000ms cast and SpellVisual
--  215, which 24 real recipes wear: putting furniture down should feel like
--  making something. sql/custom/052 binds the placement script to THIS entry,
--  which is what makes the number here load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
--
--  THIS WAS 261 UNTIL 2026-09-03 AND A RE-RUN WOULD HAVE BROKEN PLACEMENT.
--  Nothing is bound to 261, so crates carrying it cast a reticle spell that
--  reaches no script: right-click, no furniture, nothing in the log. 055 sets
--  this column too and would have put it back -- but only if somebody knew to
--  re-run it, and the file you re-ran was this one.
SET @USE    := 33453;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  The mapping table
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  scale 0 means "the size the model ships at", the same convention
--  house_object.scale uses. Set it per row to ship a model bigger or smaller
--  than the world uses it; nothing does yet.
--
--  category IS THE VENDOR'S TAB AND THE SHELF'S FILTER, one string doing both
--  jobs. Any label works -- the core groups by whatever it finds and knows
--  none of these names -- but every value below was COMPUTED by
--  tools/categorise.js rather than typed, so the tab a crate is bought from,
--  the filter it lands under on the shelf, and the bucket the addon's
--  catalogue browser files its model in are the same answer from one rule.
--  gen-furniture-items.js re-derives it and warns if this column has drifted.
--
--  The order the tabs are drawn in is the order the categories FIRST APPEAR
--  by item entry, so it is the row order below and needs no sort column:
--  Seating (100100), Tables (100102), Storage (100104), Odds & Ends (100106).
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `house_furniture_item` (
  `item_entry` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL              COMMENT 'item_template.entry',
  `go_entry`   INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL              COMMENT 'gameobject_template.entry',
  `scale`      FLOAT        NOT NULL DEFAULT 0    COMMENT '0 = the model at its own size',
  `category`   VARCHAR(24)  NOT NULL DEFAULT ''   COMMENT 'vendor tab / shelf filter; blank = untabbed',
  PRIMARY KEY (`item_entry`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

--  An install that already has the table needs the column adding, which
--  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS will not do -- that is sql/custom/062, and it
--  has to be applied BEFORE the binary that selects the column.

--  TWO ITEM RANGES, AND THEY HAVE TO STAY TWO. 100100-100199 was the original
--  block and it is nearly full; the next hundred are not available, because
--  100200-100299 is housing tools (the Decorator's Chalk is 100200) and
--  100300-100399 is critter crates. So furniture continues at 100400-100999.
--
--  NOTHING IS RENUMBERED INTO ONE CONTIGUOUS BLOCK. tw_char.item_instance,
--  house_object.item_entry and house_storage.item_entry all reference these
--  entries and there are live rows in all three -- moving one orphans somebody's
--  furniture. Two ranges is the correct answer, not a wart to tidy.
--
--  KEEP THESE IN STEP WITH `RANGES` in tools/gen-furniture-sql.js. An item
--  outside them survives a re-run of this file as an orphan: still in
--  item_template, gone from house_furniture_item, so right-clicking it does
--  nothing and nothing says why.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  The stock
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  The first twelve were chosen off the ComfyHousing catalogue, every one of
--  them from World/Generic/Human/Passive Doodads - one art set, so they furnish
--  a room together instead of looking like a sample sheet.
--
--  THE BEDS AT 100112-100114 BREAK THAT RULE ON PURPOSE (2026-09-03). A bed is
--  the one piece somebody picks for its LOOK rather than for matching the
--  chairs, so dwarf, night elf and Westfall are three different rooms to build
--  around rather than three near-identical planks. The human Feather Bed
--  (100103) is still there for anyone who wants the matched set.
--
--  100115-100163 (2026-09-04) ABANDON IT ENTIRELY, and that is what the tabbed
--  vendor is for. Forty-nine pieces across six art sets is not a matched room,
--  it is a shop - and a shop is only browsable if it is sorted, which is the
--  whole reason Adela has tabs and Bram does not.
--
--  EVERY NAME HERE WAS READ OFF THE RENDERED MODEL, not off the file path, and
--  that is not fussiness. "Garden Bench 02" is a TREE STUMP and "Garden Bench
--  03" is a mossy rock; "Chair" and "Bench" at 136929/136945 are both Dark Iron
--  chairs; "Sherpa_Bedroll_0" is unrolled and "_2" is tied shut. A player
--  buying furniture is buying a shape, so a name derived from a filename sells
--  them the wrong thing. Render one with:
--    node tools/model-browser/render.js --display <id> --sheet
--
--  DROPPED FROM THE REQUESTED LIST, both silently useless rather than wrong:
--    2003189  AbbeyShelf01_Unselectable - the same model AND the same thumbnail
--             as 2003188, so it would be a second identical shelf at the same
--             price with no way to tell them apart in the bag.
--    2003178  already sold as 100103 Feather Bed.
--    2002232  already sold as 100114 Westfall Bed.
--
--  Every entry here has a thumbnail already, which is what the addon's hover
--  preview and its storage list draw. Check before adding one:
--    grep -o "\[<goEntry>\]=[0-9]*" addon/ComfyHousing/Thumbs.lua
--  and confirm the numbered .blp exists under addon/ComfyHousing/thumbs/.
--
--  PRICES GO BY KIND, not by art set: a seat is 30s-75s, a table 75s-1g50s, a
--  shelf 1g50s-2g50s, a bed 2g50s, a cut flower 25s, a banner 1g50s, a rug
--  2g-3g and a framed painting 4g. Charging more for the dwarven table than
--  the gnome one would be pricing taste. sell_price is a fifth of buy_price
--  throughout, which is what the original fifteen already did.
--
--  material 2 is wood, which is only the pick-up sound.

--  The vendors
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  TWO OF THEM, AND THE SECOND SUPERSEDES THE FIRST. Carpenter Bram is
--  untouched: the same fifteen crates, one flat vendor window, no dialog. He
--  is left exactly as he was so an existing spawn keeps working and nothing
--  a player has already bought changes.
--
--  Furnisher Adela carries ALL SIXTY-FOUR behind a menu, one page per
--  category. Sixty-four rows in one vendor window is four pages of scrolling
--  past beds to reach a rug, which is the whole reason she exists.
--
--  So Bram is now redundant. Keep him as a starter counter or .npc delete
--  him; both are fine and neither needs an SQL change.
--
--  npc_flags: 4 is UNIT_NPC_FLAG_VENDOR in the 1.12 enum (not 128), 1 is
--  GOSSIP. ADELA NEEDS BOTH AND FOR DIFFERENT REASONS - gossip so the client
--  sends CMSG_GOSSIP_HELLO instead of opening a vendor window over the menu,
--  and vendor so GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(guid, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_VENDOR) inside
--  SendListInventory and BuyItemFromVendor still finds her. Drop either one
--  and the tabs are unreachable or unbuyable.
--
--  script_name is what makes her tabbed rather than flat: it binds
--  pGossipHello/pGossipSelect, and the menu is built in code so none of this
--  costs a gossip_menu row out of the nearly-full smallint space. Point it at
--  a second creature and there is a second tabbed shop, no code change.
--
--  faction 35 = friendly to everyone.
